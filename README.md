I use in this project HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project has techniques to be dynamic.

##### Instructions

To check the final project, open `index.html` with your favourite browser. Yet, you can check compatibility and send me back any issue you could face.

If you are not a programmer or even don't have minimum knowledge about how to deal with code, Please don't change anything in the lines inside the files included, otherwise you could have problems showing the project properly.

This is a Dynamic Responsive Project "Landing Page". It has multiple sections.
The navigation menu items are built dynamically.

### Table of Contents

#### Languages and Techniques
I use in this project HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project has techniques to be dynamic.
It shows which section is active and shown on the screen and The navigation menu items are built dynamically. It is designed to be compatible with most of recent devices.

##### Instructions

To check the final project, open `index.html` with your favourite browser. Yet, you can check compatibility and send me back any issue you could face.

If you are not a programmer or even don't have minimum knowledge about how to deal with code, Please don't change anything in the lines inside the files included, otherwise you could have problems showing the project properly.
